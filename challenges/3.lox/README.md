# 1. 
I will try them later:
Pointers are not talked about 
Are there public/private field?
What about static function or class?
How does multi inheritance work? Like Java?
Also how does array works?
Are there exception handling?
How about bitwise operators?

# 2.
1. Why does built-in functions not use parentheses?
2. Why not syntax like Python?

I think a lot of these are just... personal choices.


# 3.
Perhaps Generic from Java...
Can it handle networking?
What about concurrency?
Interfaces, Abstract class
Memory management?
